# Refactoring-Challenge-JoeSedlak

## Description

This Refactoring challenge asks us to look at the Horiseon website and optimize the codebase to follow accessibility standards.  This will result in our own site optimized for search engines. I consolidated the CSS code to be more efficent and less messy, while also adding semantic HTML to replace the confusing div elements.
